**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "RC Controller with dual processor system - STM32 microcontroller for core radio functionality and Linux SBC for application processing with video playback and settings management"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An RC pilot wants to control their aircraft using a modern, feature-rich radio controller that provides low-latency radio control, live video feed viewing, and comprehensive configuration options through an intuitive interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the controller is powered on, **When** the pilot moves the gimbals or activates switches, **Then** the radio signals are transmitted to the aircraft with minimal latency
2. **Given** a video receiver is connected, **When** the pilot turns on the controller, **Then** live video feed from the aircraft is displayed on the home screen
3. **Given** the pilot accesses the settings page, **When** they modify radio parameters, **Then** the changes are applied to the underlying radio system immediately
4. **Given** the controller is in use, **When** the pilot needs to configure WiFi or Bluetooth, **Then** they can access these settings through the application interface
5. **Given** the pilot wants to expand functionality, **When** they connect additional hardware to the expansion bay, **Then** the system can accommodate new digital video receivers

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the radio processor fails to respond to commands from the application processor?
- How does the system handle video feed interruption or poor signal quality?
- What occurs when the Linux application crashes but radio functionality needs to continue?
- How does the system behave during firmware updates of either processor?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide low-latency radio control functionality through a dedicated microcontroller
- **FR-002**: System MUST support standard JR bay connector for radio module compatibility
- **FR-003**: System MUST accept input from gimbals and switches for aircraft control
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide communication interface between radio processor and application processor
- **FR-005**: System MUST display live video feed from analog video receivers on the home screen
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a settings interface for configuring radio parameters
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide WiFi and Bluetooth configuration capabilities
- **FR-008**: System MUST support expansion bay for future digital video receiver modules
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain radio functionality independently from application processor state
- **FR-010**: System MUST prioritize radio control latency over other system functions
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide user interface for comprehensive controller configuration
- **FR-012**: System MUST support video playback from connected video receivers
- **FR-013**: System MUST be designed to accommodate future autonomous flight control features
- **FR-014**: Radio processor MUST run real-time operating system for deterministic timing. Reading Analog Inputs from gimbals switches, mixer calculations, sending signals to RF module should be highest priority. Reading configuration changes should be medium priority, any other operations should be low priority.
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle processor communication failures gracefully. If there is a communication failure the microcontroller should keep running using existing configuration. The updated configuration should be sent as soon as communication is recovered.
- **FR-016**: System MUST support firmware updates. Firmware updates will be done over the air for the Application Processor (AP) and the AP will be responsible for updating the Firmware of the microcontroller.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Radio Configuration**: Parameters for mixer settings, channel mapping, flight modes, and failsafe behaviors
- **Video Stream**: Live video feed data from analog and digital video receivers
- **Control Input**: Gimbal positions, switch states, and auxiliary control inputs
- **System Settings**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth pairings, display preferences, and system configuration
- **Hardware Profile**: Connected modules, expansion bay contents, and peripheral device configurations
